# Robotics
This is my assignment for ΜΥΕ031 course. The goal is to design desired trajectories and program the motion of a wheeled robot differential drive, Clearpath's Jackal, (a) in a simulated environment and (b) in real-world conditions. The simulation environment will be created using the ROS, RViz and/or Gazebo software packages.
